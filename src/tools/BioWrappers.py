    At the very start, you need to turn the text of a PDB file into an in-memory object you can 
    interrogate. Biopython’s PDBParser does exactly that:

    You give it the path to a .pdb file.

    It reads all the ATOM/HETATM records, builds up a hierarchy of Structure → Model → Chain → 
    Residue → Atom, and returns that structure.

    Since most PDBs have a single “Model 0,” the helper immediately returns structure[0] 
    so that downstream code works purely against a Model object.

    Once you have the Model, you often want to know how deeply buried each residue is inside the 
    protein core. The ResidueDepth class from Biopython wraps an algorithm that:
    Computes the molecular surface of the whole structure,

    For each residue, finds all its constituent atoms,

    Measures the distance from each atom back to the solvent-accessible surface, and

    Defines the residue’s “depth” as the minimum over its atoms.

    Sometimes you only care about a small set of residues—say those you found experimentally 
    to touch another molecule. This helper:

Calls get_surface(model) to compute exactly the same molecular surface that ResidueDepth 
would have used.

Iterates over your provided list of contact-residue identifiers (each also a (chain, resnum) tuple).

For each, grabs the corresponding Residue object from the Model, and calls the standalone 
function residue_depth(res, surface) to measure that single residue’s depth against the precomputed surface.

Returns a dict mapping each of your input residues to its depth.

    Hydrogen-shell exposure (HSE) is another way to quantify how exposed a residue’s Cα 
    atom is, by counting how many of its immediate neighbors lie above or below the Cα 
    plane. Biopython’s HSExposureCA class handles this:
    You give it the full Model and it builds an internal map of every residue’s Cα environment.

Iterating its keys (again (chain, Residue)), you get for each a tuple (up_count, down_count, raw_angle).

The helper rekeys each entry to (chain, residue_number), and ensures you never get a None angle by substituting 0.0.
